# Rocket-Payload-Telemetry-GUI
This project involves developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the payload of a rocket. The GUI processes data received from integrated telemetry systems within the payload and transmits it to a server. The server then interprets this data and presents it to the user through visual graphs.
